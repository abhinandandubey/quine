# quine
A NonEmpty Quine In Java Using ProcessBuilder Runtime - "Computer Recreations: Self-Reproducing Automata" Jean Millo, 1972

The quine is made essentially on a total new concept of using a ProcessBuilder to act as a reproducing agent. The program gives as output its own source code, and can be worked out on Windows platform.

Current Possibilities:

- Making the Program Cross-Platform (The program provides abilities using if-else to get the platform (OS) and thus can be made flexible for working on iOS and Unix very easily.
- Open to other possibilities.

Inspired by "Computer Recreations: Self-Reproducing Automata" Jean Millo, 1972
